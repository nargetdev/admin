Hello guys.  I figured this might be a convenient way to communicate for the 
time being.  Check it occasionally for updates on what we're each upto.

If we wanted to get fancy you could use tmux to split your terminal and keep a 
buffer watching this file and we could effectively have live chat  ;D

Does this work?

Yeah this works for now Nate. Just make sure to add timestamps and your name
to these comments so we have a better idea of who is doing what.  

/*Ignore this for now
Also Nate,
I think since you made this file we can't modify it and upload it using FTP
unless you do something.

Look on Piazza, there's something about changing the owner of the file on the
eecs485 machine to allow all 3 of us to be able to make changes to the file
that you made.

I added some code at the end of the POST request part for albums/edit. Seems
to keep it on the same page when you add or delete an album!
